# SortingAlgorithms
 
This is a repository meant to hold some examples of personal implementations of different sorting methodologies in an effort to gain familiarity and better understanding of the differences between them. 
 
## Algorithms
### Bubble sort
The bubble sort algorithm implemented herein is a fairly standard one, as the algorithm itself is remarkably simple.  There is some optimization, however.  Notably, it will use the index of the last swap made in a pass as the maximum index to check on the next pass.  This should avoid unnecessary comparisons on subsequent passes, as it has already been determined that those elements are in the proper order.

### Selection sort
Simple, standard implementation of a selection sort.

### Insertion sort
Standard implementation of an insertion sort.

### Heap sort
A pretty na√Øve implementation of using a binary heap to sort an array of elements.  This module only implements the initial creation of a heap, and does not include any mechanism to insert or remove elements once it is created, as we only care about using it to sort data.

### Merge sort
Simplistic, recursive implementation of a merge sort.

## Testing
Tests are written in mocha and may require this library be installed.

ex:

```sh
sudo npm install -g mocha
```

Otherwise, ```npm run test ``` will execute the tests.
